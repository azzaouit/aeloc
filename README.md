A spatial data oracle for the EVM

## System Requirements

At least 4GB RAM is recommended. Lite nodes should be able to run on a Raspberry pi.

For a full node with a complete planet database and minutely diffs, 16GB RAM and at least 1TB NVME is recommended.
Keep in mind that the OSM database is actively growing.
